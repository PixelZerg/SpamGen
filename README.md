# SpamGen
A program that tries to mimic spamming on a keyboard like a human - subproject of KI

If you think about it, this task is probably more difficult then you anticipated (although it isn't a very difficult algorithm).
This program pretends that it is spamming on a QWERTY keyboard and rather than choosing random keys to spam, it tries to spam like a human would.
Aka: pressing keys directly after eachother on the keyboard, going backwards randomly, swiping, going down rows (going diagonally) of the QWERTY keyboard, etc.
